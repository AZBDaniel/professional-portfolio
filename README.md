# Profressional Portfolio

## Description 

WHAT - Website created to show case my own work as a developer going through school and entering the development industry.

WHY - It gives information about who I am, how to get ahold of me, and show case projects I work on in a visual base setting.

HOW - My portfolio website will improve and updated as I learn new skills, langagues and improve my coding. It show off what I what I know at this time with it being the face of my work, it allows employeers and other developers to see my coding style, and practices.

MODIVATION - Well my modivation I feel I answer above but I will clarify a little more here, I want this to be a live visual resume for developers and employeers to see, to allow my work to speak for me, and give more information about my self in practice and application.

PROBLEMS SOLVED - This website solves the problem of having to share multiple website HTML when asked about my work portfolio. I can simple list this website on any of my proflies on socail media or place it on paper resume, giving more depth and information about my self and work.

LEARNED - Prior to this project FLEXBOX I struggled with, the basic concept made sense to me but when applying it I would get lost in how the boxes interact and are created within each other. I had to start with fresh code three times before I really started to get FLEXBOX down. I would not say I am amazing at it yet but I have a better understanding now then I did before.


FUTURE UPDATES - I would like to do some more work with the media queries for screen sizes. This area I need more time perfecting my understanding and knowledge on best struture in the formating of the classes before the media query. This will allow easier and less rigid changes to lay out for screen sizes.
